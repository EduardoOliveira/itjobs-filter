# ITJobs filter

This is a Userscript that, when used on [ITJobs jobs search portal](https://www.itjobs.pt/), will allow you to filter out some companies.
Use [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) to install and run it.  
This first version was tested in Firefox 57 beta with Tampermonkey but may work in Google Chrome and others as well.  
Use at your own risk. This was done in my free time just to have some fun.  

## Usage

If run successfully, you will be able to hide a company from listings by hovering the mouse over the company's logo and clicking the button.  
A list of hidden companies will then be shown on the left bar. Click the name again to put that company back on the main listings.  
Since the site does not seem to support this kind of filtering, everything is done by JavaScript, which will result in list with weird sizes.  
One of my objectives was to integrate this new feature in the site without changing the appearance. When using the script for the first time, you should see no obvious difference.
